# Comparative Between Topic Modeling Techniques

Study conducted with the purpose of evaluate the performance of different topic modeling techniques, namely NMF (Non-Negative Matrix Factorization), LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing), LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) and lda2vec.

**Note:** For now, only NMF model is implemented. Other models will be implemented soon.
